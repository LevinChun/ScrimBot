ScrimBot is Discord bot meant to allow for the easy creation of VALORANT custom matches.

 You tell the bot how many players per team, when the match will be and what map you would like and the bot will do the rest. Interested players can then react to the message to join a team, and once the match is complete you can add the final score and the match will be recorded for posterity.

 Players can also tell the bot their competitive rank and it will automatically assign them a role in all servers that they share with the bot.
